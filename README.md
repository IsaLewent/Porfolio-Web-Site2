## 📖 About The Project

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, services, and creative approach to web development. The goal was to create a **minimalist yet immersive experience** that breaks away from traditional layouts.

The site features a unique **Side Navigation Bar**, seamless page transitions, and high-end interactions powered by **GSAP**. It is fully responsive and optimized for performance using **Vite**.

### Key Sections
* **Hero Section:** A visually striking introduction with 3D-style elements.
* **Side Navigation:** An interactive sidebar for smooth navigation between sections.
* **Services:** A detailed breakdown of the technical solutions I offer.
* **Contact:** A streamlined area for potential collaborations.
